    *AnimalHack 2024
        ? AnimalHack is a platform that inspires you to think of needs, wants and challenges in interacting with animals. Solutions can take many different forms!

    
    Expected project topics include, but are not limited to: 

    * Contributing to animal wellbeing 

    * Assisting animal owners 

    * Assisting animal adoptions !

    * Monitoring, conserving and improving the environment around animals 

    * Observing, tracing and protecting wild animals 

    * Breeding, rearing/farming and harvesting animals 

    * Managing nuisance issues with wildlife

    * Addressing animal abuse, cruelty and illegal capture/trade 

 

Solutions can take many different forms such as apps, games, social platforms, web sites/services, devices, robots, data collection/storage, data analysis/forecasts, data visualization, information retrieval, and 3-dimensional modeling/printing. 

AnimalHack is a “flexible” online hackathon. Participants can work on their projects anytime until the event starts. Each participant/team is required to submit a project presentation title and contact information by 12pm on September 7 (Sat), EST. 

AnimalHack will take place at 1pm on September 8 (Sun), EST. Each participant/team will deliver a project presentation (~10 minutes) online. Various awards are available. A panel of judges will select award winners at the end of the event. 

AnimalHack is hosted by Binnovative, a nonprofit organization in Massachusetts.

We will publish a book that features the projects presented at AnimalHack 2024. Selected participants will be invited to extend their project abstracts and publish them as book chapters. 
We are planning to publish this book through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.
